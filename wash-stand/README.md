## Equipment:
* 4 x uprights - 80cm
* 2 x short cross piece - 40cm
* 2 x long cross piece - 60cm
* 8 x 1m string for lashings
* Mallet

If we can get some flat slats to create a surface to put things on, this would be great, but not essential.

## Steps:
Place the bowl on the ground, with the long cross pieces at the longer sides of the bowl.
Mallet the verticals into the ground at ~10cm in from each end of, and touching, each cross piece. They should go in ~10cm.

Have the shortest person you expect to use the gadget stand next to it, holding one of the longer cross pieces.
If it was 'inside' the verticals on the ground, then it should remain so while they hold it.
Up to two people can now square lash the cross piece to the verticals.
Repeat for the other long cross piece.

Place the bowl between the horizontals now attached to the stand - it should stay in place.
Place the shorter cross pieces on top of the longer ones, perpendicular to them and 'outside' the verticals.

Have one person hold the longer cross pieces tight against the sides of the bowl while up to four others square lash the shorter cross pieces _to the verticals_.

If you have slats, push the bowl to one end & snake lash the slats in the space between the bowl and the other end.
This creates a flat area you can put your wash kit/soap/scrubbing brush on while washing.
